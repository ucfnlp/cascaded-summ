Data for the AACL-IJCNLP 2020 paper "A Cascaded Approach to Neural Abstractive Summarization with Content Selection and Fusion"

# Data

Our data consists of > 1 million **sentence fusion** instances, of the form: 

    Input: one or two articles sentences + token-level highlights indicating which tokens were used to create the output summary sentence
